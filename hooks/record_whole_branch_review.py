"""PostToolUse hook (matcher: Agent). Part of enforcing "don't skip the
final whole-branch review".

When an Agent dispatch looks like the final whole-branch review (mentions
the review skill/phrase), records the current git HEAD sha to a sentinel
file. protect_ready_without_review.py (PreToolUse on marking a PR ready)
reads this sentinel to confirm a whole-branch review actually happened at
the current commit before the PR can leave draft.

**Known limitation**: this only checks that a dispatch *prompt* mentioned
review language - it does not verify the dispatched agent actually ran,
returned, or reported a clean result before recording the sentinel. A
dispatch that matches the pattern but fails, gets interrupted, or returns
findings still marks the sentinel as satisfied. Combined with
protect_reviewer_prejudging.py's phrase-blocklist limitation, "PR left
draft" mechanically guarantees only that a review-shaped Agent call was
*made* at this commit, not that it passed."""

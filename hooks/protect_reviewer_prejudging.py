"""PreToolUse hook enforcing a subagent-driven-development rule: never tell
a reviewer what not to flag or pre-rate a finding's severity. Think it's a
false positive -> let it be raised, settle it in the loop.

Scans an Agent-tool dispatch prompt for language that pre-judges a
reviewer's findings before the reviewer has seen the diff. The controller
must rewrite the prompt so any concern about a specific finding is raised
AFTER the reviewer reports it, not baked into the dispatch.

**Known limitation**: this is a fixed phrase blocklist, so it only catches
prejudging language that matches one of these specific patterns - a
rephrase ("skip that one", "not worth flagging", "no significant issue
there") passes through undetected. It raises the bar against the common
phrasings observed so far; it is not a semantic check.

**HIGH severity, override available.** Denies by default. Override via
the same sentinel-file mechanism as the other guards - write
`<hooks dir>/.pending_override.json` with `{"rule":
"protect_reviewer_prejudging", "target": "<dispatch description>",
"reason": "<reason>", "timestamp": <time.time()>}`. Kept HIGH rather than
CRITICAL: a prejudged review is recoverable (dispatch a fresh, unbiased
one), unlike data loss or a corrupted shipped artifact."""
